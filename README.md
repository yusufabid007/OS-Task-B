## 🖼️ **1. Visual / Interface Design**

What to include:

* High-fidelity wireframes (mobile/desktop versions if applicable)
* Navigation layout and interactions
* Annotated UI design elements (e.g., buttons, forms, error messages)
* Accessibility features (e.g., contrast, alt text, keyboard nav)

**In your README:**

* Embed wireframe images
* List tools used (e.g., Figma, Canva, draw.io)
* Note how design supports accessibility and user experience


---

## 🗃️ **2. Data Requirements**

What to include:

* **Variables, data types, structures**
* **Naming conventions**
* **Data validation rules** (e.g., email format, required fields)
* **Security considerations** (e.g., password hashing, access control)
* **Diagrams**:

  * Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
  * Use Case Diagram
  * Class Diagram (if OOP is used)
  * Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
  * Data Dictionary

**In your README:**

* Link to or embed all diagrams
* Provide a table explaining key fields from your data dictionary
* Briefly explain what data is collected and why


---

## 🔄 **3. Algorithm Designs**

What to include:

* Max 5 **key problems or features** (login, data sorting, validation, etc.)
* **Pseudocode** for logic clarity
* **Flowcharts** showing control flow (decision-making, loops)
* Inputs → Processing → Outputs
* Follow **naming and indentation conventions**

**In your README:**

* Explain which problems your algorithms solve
* Link to flowcharts and pseudocode
* Optional: short video/gif of feature demo


---

## 🧪 **4. Test Strategy**

What to include:

* **Unit testing**: test individual functions/modules
* **Integration testing**: test combined components
* **Security testing**: input validation, authentication
* Test **order** and **dependencies**
* Explain which tests apply to which components

**In your README:**

* Describe your test approach (manual or automated)
* Include test table with:

  * Component
  * Type of test
  * Expected output
  * Actual result
* Link to any test script files


---

## 🗣️ **5. Clear Communication**

What to do:

* Keep design docs professional and clear
* Include both technical terms and simplified explanations
* Label all diagrams and explain what they show
* Show how the documentation supports development

**In your README:**

* Write an intro paragraph explaining what this repo is for
* Summarise what's in each section and how it connects to the project
* Mention compliance/security where relevant


---

## 🖼️ **6. Relevant Diagrams**

| Diagram              | Purpose                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **ERD**              | Show tables and relationships (for databases)       |
| **Use Case Diagram** | Show what the user can do (user/system interaction) |
| **Class Diagram**    | For object-oriented designs (attributes/methods)    |
| **DFD**              | Show how data flows through your app                |
| **Data Dictionary**  | Define fields, types, constraints                   |

**In your README:**

* Embed or link all diagrams
* Add a sentence per diagram explaining what it is for


---

## 📎 **7. Appendices**

* Screenshots of working prototypes
* Notes from initial sketches or mockups
* Evidence of planning (e.g., Trello board)
* References for any frameworks or libraries used

**In your README:**

* Link to appendix folder if in repo
* Mention any important sources or frameworks
